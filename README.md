# Another-Earth
An immersive 2D sci-fi Unity game that has a fun and dark storyline with creative characters woven into the paradoxical plot.

We developed this game for the sci-fi enthusiasts who wanted more out of the 2D genre. It's a mix of cosmic horror, funny characters and conversations, and an epic soundtrack to set the mood for players.

Since it was a game developed on Unity, we ran into some errors while coding the character attributes and importing certain libraries, audio and video files. But we fixed those bugs and we are happy to announce that the game is ready-to-play on Itch.io (links below)

"Another Earth" is an immersive 2D sci-fi cosmic game that takes players on a captivating journey through a mysterious planet. In this game, players step into the shoes of a character who finds themselves guided by enigmatic creatures and tasked with solving intriguing yet enjoyable puzzles. The game's unique selling point lies in its paradoxical theme, where players are compelled to replay it to explore different choices and witness how the story unfolds.

With a focus on delivering an exceptional player experience, "Another Earth" boasts a visually stunning 8-bit art style and incorporates innovative gameplay mechanics and an awesome inventory that keep players engaged and entertained. Moments of seriousness are interrupted by elements of fun to keep the mood balanced.


Albeit the game's linear storyline, that would be boring. So to add an extra layer of innovation to incentivize players into exploring replayability of the game, we added multiple endings that the player can explore through subsequent runs. As to how many endings there are, that's for the players to discover. We also dropped some not-so-obvious easter eggs along the way, which we hope only the most true gamers will find.
